# OpenAI-api-tutorial

A Tiny project where I show you OpenAIâ€™s Chat Completion API to build a dynamic conversational AI tool. This API allows developers to adjust the tone / context of the chat!

A Quick Guide:
Set Up OpenAI:
Start by installing the OpenAI Python package: pip install openai
Get your API key from the OpenAI dashboard.
Messages: is where magic happens , there is three main roles you can use (system, user, and assistant). 
the role (system): define the tone/context of the response
the role (user): is the message request itself
the role (assistant): is the response itself , when we write it  , that means we make an example to the api to give us similer like response
Explore Further: You can customize prompts, control response length, and even set the tone or personality of the assistant. This opens up endless possibilities for creating highly interactive tools!
